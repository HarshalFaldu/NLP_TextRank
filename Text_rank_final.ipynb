There has been no prize money to play for over the best part of three months but that hasn't stopped it being discussed.The ATP and WTA tours, the International Tennis Federation and the four Grand Slam tournaments -- the Australian Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open backed a fund worth more than $6 million to support low-ranked players hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.World number one Novak Djokovic had already said that he, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal -- the sport's biggest earners with over $100 million each banked in prize money alone -- were also willing to help.However, world number three Dominic Thiem was not keen on giving money to lower-ranked players.\"Quite honestly I have to say that no tennis player will be fighting to survive, even those who are much lower-ranked,\" said the Austrian.Marion Bartoli, the 2013 Wimbledon champion, chimed in last week by suggesting a reduction in doubles events with prize money diverted to struggling players.\"You just don't make the same effort (in doubles) as a singles player. The United States Tennis Association will decide in mid-June on the US Open in New York.AFP Sport looks at three talking points as the sport heads into June:Fans in or out at US Open and Roland Garros?In 2019, the US Open attracted a record crowd of almost 740,000 to its sprawling Billie Jean King Tennis Centre in New York.The French Open last year at Roland Garros brought in 520,000 paying customers.However, the 2020 editions of the two remaining Grand Slam events on the calendar will look very different with the chance of them being played behind closed doors a real possibility to avoid the spread of the coronavirus.Roger Federer, whose 20-Grand Slam title haul includes five titles at the US Open and one in Paris, is not keen on seeing rows and rows of empty seats.\"I can't bear to see an empty stadium\n",

On Sunday, with the Big 3 away, the Austrian and the German had the best chance they would ever have to put childish things away and leave their cant win the big one reputations behind.So how did they do? Did they pass the audition? We can start by saying that Thiem and Zverev made the most of their time on the stage if anything, thats an understatement\n",
